# 12 - Future Extensions

This section lists potential extensions that remain aligned with the current blueprint direction. They are not part of the scope unless explicitly approved.

## Visual Enhancements
- Optional environment map if it supports the technical aesthetic
- Subtle post-processing only if it does not dilute blueprint clarity

## Interaction Extensions
- Additional metadata in overlays if it maps to real architectural data
- Component-level focus states, without camera motion

## Structural Growth
- More modular parts using the same component pattern
- Reuse of geometry and materials to preserve performance

## Tooling
- Threlte Studio for inspection during development only
- Expanded GLB pipeline if new assets are introduced
